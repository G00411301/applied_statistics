Within the $t$-test category of analysis, there are the option of independent and dependent or paired $t$-tests. Understanding the data and its context is important for determining the most approriate test to perform in each scenario. A paired sample $t$-test is performed when there are two sets of results that are related to each other eg. comparing results from before and after a specific action where result x in the before and result x in the after both relate to subject y, for example, if you were testing a persons reflexes before and after drinking alcohol.\n",

The independent $t$-test is the most appriate of the two in this case as the plants being evaluated are not related in any way, it is not possible to test the same plant under each of the conditions/before and after a change in treatment so the samples are in no way related"
